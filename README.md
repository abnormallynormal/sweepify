💡 Inspiration
Litter is a visible problem in many urban environments, yet few people feel motivated to do something about it. We wanted to change that. Inspired by fitness apps and point-based reward systems, we created Sweepify — a platform that makes cleaning up garbage not only easy but fun and rewarding. Our goal is to spark local environmental action using technology.

🚀 What It Does
📸 Lets users take before and after pictures of litter cleanups
📍 Uses GPS to log cleanup locations
💰 Rewards users with points for verified cleanups
📊 Displays a real-time leaderboard of top contributors
🤖 (Coming Soon) Uses AI to verify photo authenticity and prevent cheating
🌍 Highlights "hotspots" — areas with frequently reported garbage

🛠️ How We Built It
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla + basic animations)
Backend: Flask + Python
Database: Firebase (Realtime Database)
Authentication: Firebase Auth
Image Handling: Cloudinary
Geolocation: Roboflow API + Google Maps API
Design Tools: Figma for prototyping, Canva for logo/icons
AI (Future Plan): Model to verify authenticity of photos

🧠 Challenges We Ran Into
Connecting Backend to Frontend (obviously)
Installing and gaining accsess to high profile API's + configuring them
Deciding how to insentify the need for our app
